I have recently upated my Windows dev environment. This [tutorial by Kia Zhi Tang]([url](https://kiazhi.github.io/blog/Working-with-Jekyll-and-Ruby-on-Windows-for-GitHub-Pages/)) was really useful to install the Windows Linux subsystem on Windows 10. I install [rvm]([url](https://rvm.io/rvm/security)) and could use it after updating the PATH in Ubuntu.
