Hey there, I am using GitHub ;) 

I am pretty interested in technical writing and documentation in general. Always learning Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bash/Shell.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on documentation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub Actions and workflow automation.

I have recently updated my development environment to the Windows Linux subsystem on Windows 10. This [tutorial by Kia Zhi Tang](https://kiazhi.github.io/blog/Working-with-Jekyll-and-Ruby-on-Windows-for-GitHub-Pages/) was really useful. I installed [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and could use it after updating the PATH to install Ruby. I also switched to VSCode which I installed using this [linuxize.com tutorial](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-on-ubuntu-18-04/).
