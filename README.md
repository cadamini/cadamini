Hey there, I am using GitHub ;) 

I am pretty interested in technical writing and documentation in general. Always learning Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bash/Shell.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on documentation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub Actions and workflow automation.

I have recently updated my development environment to the Windows Linux subsystem on Windows 10:   

- To get started with WSLm, this [tutorial by Kia Zhi Tang](https://kiazhi.github.io/blog/Working-with-Jekyll-and-Ruby-on-Windows-for-GitHub-Pages/) was really useful. 
- To install Ruby. I installed [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and could use it after updating the PATH. 
- I switched to VSCode. I installed it using the [VSCode Remote WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial) - after reopening WSL `code .` installed the VC Code Server. 

I can now open WSL folders in Windows and Windows folders from WSL using `code .` command in the terminal. Great!
